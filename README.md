### 1. Wireframes

I used Balsamiq tool for the wireframes and attached them to the workspace within their own directory at the root level. While I did not spend too much time on the design at that stage,.
For the tablet format, I chose to use the horizontal size (1024x780) as this is how most users would use their tablet size to see websites. 

Please find a few wireframes showing the main page, the Our Team, the signup and payment. All the other wireframes can be found [here](https://github.com/mkuti/corklagos-venture/tree/master/wireframes)

# Technologies Used: 

### Languages:

- __HTML__ language is used to create the structure of the website and game.
- __CSS__ language is used to add styling on the structure of the website.
- __Javascript__ functioning language is used to fetch external data and add interactivity on the website so the game functions based on user's actions
- __Python__ Object-oriented programming and structured programming language which allows smooth communication between the backend and frontend. 

### Tools & Libraries:
- [GitPod](gitpod.io) - I used __GitPod__ as my IDE for the development of this website.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) - The website uses __jQuery__ and __Popper.js__ to bring in Javascript which makes the navbar responsive
-  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - The website is using __Bootstrap4__ as the basic structure and grid of the website and to increase the responsiveness of the website.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - I used jQuery to avoid repeating same actions on the DOM when buttons were clicked
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - I used Flask framework, Jinja templates and Werkzeug to 
Python werkzeug.check_password_hash()
- [FontAwesome](https://kit.fontawesome.com/f7e192f540.js) - The website is using __Font Awesome__ to display the social media icons in my footer
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)- The website uses __Google font__- Url imported in CSS
- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - I have used __AutoPrefixer__ to make sure the css code worked on all browsers
- [Tiny.jpg](https://tinyjpg.com) - I have used __Tinyjpg__ to compress logo image of the website to increase the website loading on browser
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - I have used __ColorSpace__ to find matching colors for the website
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud) - I have used __Balsamic__ to build the wireframes which I then exported to the IDE
- [Favicon converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) - I used Favicon converter to convert the logo into a favicon which I was able to insert in the asset folder and I tested it to be working
- [Sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/)
- [Unicorn Revealer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB) Chrome extension to show content structure, margin and paddings and fix any offset
- [Lunapic](https://www2.lunapic.com/editor/) - to make the logo transparent
- [Spinkit](https://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/) - for the loader css and html
- [Techsini Multi-Mockup](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php) - to create multi-device photo of README
- [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#) for generating Markdown tables for README

# Deployment
I have been using the Integrated development environment (IDE) [GitPod](gitpod.io) to develop this milestone project.
As I used it for the first time and Code Institute changed the preferred IDE for the whole course, I was lucky to avail of the full template prepared by Code Institute at the time.

I went to Code Institute [full template repository](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template), cloned it and created my own repository with the template ready. From there, I opened GitPod which started a workspace.

From that point, I could add, commit any update of my code and push it to the remote repository so it could be regularly backed up and accessed by others.

### GitHub
All versions and branches of the code are stored in github:


## How to run this project locally

To run this project on your own IDE follow the instructions below:

Ensure you have the following tools: 
- An IDE such as [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)

The following **must be installed** on your machine:
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)
- If you use Code Institute template, all the above will be already installed
- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/3.0/)
- 
- 
...

### Instructions
1. Install all required modules with the command 
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

2. In your local IDE create a file called `env.py`

3. Inside the env.py file, create a SECRET_KEY variable 

4. Make sure to add env.py to a .gitignore file so it's not pushed to the repository

4. You can now run the application with the command
```python3 manage.py runserver```

9. You can visit the website at ``

## Heroku Deployment

To deploy the app to heroku, you would need to follow the following steps:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

2. Create a `Procfile` with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.

3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.

3. Create a new app on the [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to Europe.

4. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.

5. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.

6. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".

7. Set the following config vars:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
SECRET_KEY | `<your_secret_key>`

8. In the heroku dashboard, click "Deploy".

9. In the "Manual Deployment" section of this page, made sure the master branch is selected and then click "Deploy Branch".

10. The site is now successfully deployed.
